This doc is intended to be used as a reference for useful things you learn about Rails. 
Feel free to add onto it, I just thought I would compile a list of things that are useful.

COMMANDS:

bundle i
    installs anything in your Gemfile. If you are "missing gems ..." or something of the like, 
    try running this, then run the command below to start the application. Hopefully, that was
    the only issue.

rails s
    starts the application. Must be ran in the same directory as the rails application. Make sure you don't
    have another rails application running when you run this command, as it will not work if you do.

rails c
    starts the rails console. This lets you interact with your application (while it is running. See the command
    above for running the application). Very useful for debugging database issues, as well as testing individual lines of code.

    Any code you write here will run when you press "enter". Models are especially useful as you can test if they are
    functioning properly by using "ModelName.[method here]" to see what is returned.

    Examples:
        User.find(1) # retrieves the user from the database with the id of 1 (does not store in any variable)
        user = User.find(1) # stores the retrieved user from the database in the variable "user"
        user.events # returns all the events that this user is invited too
                    # (only works because of the has_and_belongs_to_many keyword in the User Model)

        Event.all # returns all the events in the database in an array

rails generate [scaffold / model / migration / controller] [name]
    generates the boilerplate code for a lot of these things. Very useful for quickly and easily adding new things.

rails db:migrate
    runs all the new migrations in your migrations folder in ./db/
    run this if you see "pending migrations"

    if you want to revert or migrate to a specific version, add VERSION=[version_number]
    Example: 
        rails db:migrate VERSION=0 # resets the database schema back to its original, unmigrated form

rails routes
    shows all the routes in your application. If you're on Mac, you can pipe this into a "grep" to filter out certain routes.
    
    Example:
        rails routes # gets all the routes in your application

        rails routes | grep "user" # gets all routes with "user" somewhere in the name
